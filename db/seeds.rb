# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# user = User.create(name: "Alex", username: "Alex123", password: "123")

# alex = User.first 

# alex_trip = alex.trips.create(name: "Tar Pit Hangout", start_date: "2021-07-04", end_date: "2021-07-10")

# alex_trip.visits.create(attraction_id: 1, date: "2021-07-04")

# alex.comments.create(content: "Best pits in town!", user_id: 1, attraction_id: 1)
